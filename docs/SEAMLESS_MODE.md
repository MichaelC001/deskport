# Experimental Seamless Mode

Status: experimental server-side M1/M2 skeleton; native Linux verification and
the remote client/media path remain incomplete, 2026-10-05.

Seamless Mode is a second Linux hosting mode in which each remote Wayland
top-level surface is represented by a real top-level window on a Linux Wayland
client. It is not a replacement for the existing Desktop Mode, and it is not a
Wayland protocol proxy.

The initial target is deliberately narrow:

- Linux server and Linux Wayland client;
- one user, one session, one software-rendered application;
- a headless server without GNOME, KDE, a physical display, or a GPU;
- server-side surface rendering followed by DeskPort transport; and
- one local native window for the first rendering proof.

The first application should be a simple terminal using `wl_shm`. Firefox,
VS Code, XWayland, GPU buffers, multiple windows, audio, drag-and-drop, and IME
are later compatibility work.

## Non-regression contract

Desktop Mode remains the default and must retain its current behavior.

Today a native desktop session uses the existing Sunshine/GameStream host,
Moonlight transport, a full display or virtual output, one SDL viewer window,
and the existing input and decoder callbacks. The Qt/QML window is the control
shell; a desktop session worker owns the SDL media window and the legacy media
context. Adaptive display changes the remote desktop size and may restart the
desktop video transport.

That implementation has intentionally global assumptions, including one active
Moonlight callback owner, one `SDL_Window`, one decoder, and one input handler.
It is therefore treated as the Desktop Mode implementation, rather than being
refactored into a premature common base class.

Adding Seamless Mode must not:

- change Desktop Mode negotiation, capture, decoding, input, resize, clipboard,
  window recall, or background-session behavior;
- reinterpret old peer messages or make an old peer enter Seamless Mode;
- change saved Desktop Mode settings or migrate Moonlight credentials;
- make `deskport host run` depend on a new compositor unless
  `--mode seamless` was explicitly selected; or
- turn one remote application into one independent Moonlight session.

Regression checks for Desktop Mode remain release gates even while Seamless Mode
is experimental.

## Existing components and ownership

The following table defines what is reusable and what remains mode-specific.

| Component | Seamless use | Ownership boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Peer binding, pinned certificates, mutual TLS, revocation | Reuse | `PeerManager` remains the authority for an approved peer identity. |
| Session admission, takeover, topology, lifecycle, and lease | Future reuse; not wired for Seamless | The current one-shot preflight does not acquire a lease. A cross-mode exclusive admission gate must cover Desktop, browser, and Seamless before M3. |
| New optional wire constants and validation | Reuse through the shared core | The contract belongs in `shared/deskport-core`; the Git submodule and Nix pin move together. |
| Host child-process supervision and diagnostics patterns | Implemented locally | `SeamlessHostManager` owns one sidecar process, validates its bounded JSON events, and tears down that exact child. It does not own remote admission. |
| Clipboard synchronization | Reuse later at session scope | Clipboard must not block the first surface proof and is not per-window. |
| Browser WebRTC transport | Possible future media building block | It currently carries one full-display H.264 track and is not a per-surface native-client receiver. |
| Sunshine/GameStream capture and Moonlight callbacks | Desktop only for now | They capture a display and expose a single legacy media context. |
| `Session`, `SdlInputHandler`, adaptive display resize | Desktop only | Their single-window and whole-display semantics do not match a window-ID protocol. |
| Existing QML control window and device cards | Unchanged | Seamless Mode must not introduce a second card layout or a giant transparent canvas. |

        +---- lifecycle/captured frames ----------> SeamlessWindowRegistry
                                                          |
                                                          v
                                                one QWindow per remote
                                                xdg_toplevel surface
```

`deskport-seamless-host` is a separate sidecar under
`host/linux/seamless/`. Keeping it out of the main Qt/QML shell and out of the
patched Sunshine process gives it an explicit lifetime, a private Wayland socket,
and a narrow failure boundary. The implemented `SeamlessHostManager` supervises
one local sidecar, validates its bounded event stream, and stops the exact process
it started. It is not yet bound to an admitted remote Seamless session or lease.

The sidecar owns these server responsibilities:

1. create a private Wayland display and XDG shell;
2. launch an application with only that display in its environment;
3. assign an opaque, session-scoped ID to each top-level;
4. report create, metadata, map/configure, and destroy lifecycle events;
5. observe buffer commits and expose a bounded capture interface; and
6. later accept focus, close, pointer, keyboard, and configure requests.

The sidecar does not own peer credentials, remote admission policy, public
listeners, or long-lived settings. Those remain in the DeskPort host process.
On the current branch that host-side remote work stops at an approved-peer,
one-shot capability preflight; production lifecycle/media dispatch is not wired.

One client Seamless session owns a registry of remote window IDs. It must use one
process per remote host session, not one process per remote window. Every registry
entry eventually owns a native, parentless `QWindow`. The initial software path
uses `QBackingStore` and `QImage`; later decoders or a QRhi renderer can be hidden
behind a surface-renderer interface without changing window lifecycle.

## Why Qt Wayland Compositor

The first server implementation uses Qt Wayland Compositor.

It matches the repository's C++/Qt build and event-loop model, provides public
XDG shell and surface lifecycle APIs, and provides `QWaylandSurfaceGrabber` and
`QWaylandBufferRef` for reading surface content. This makes a small lifecycle and
`wl_shm` capture proof possible without first writing a complete window manager.
It also keeps the initial implementation compatible with software rendering.

The choice is scoped, not irreversible:

- **Weston headless:** Weston is a mature reference compositor and its headless
  and Pixman paths are useful for tests. Stock Weston, however, composites
  surfaces into an output. DeskPort still needs a shell/plugin or libweston
  integration to identify and capture individual application surfaces.
  Libweston's public API is explicitly still evolving, so that integration would
  add a version-sensitive plugin boundary before the first proof.
- **wlroots:** wlroots exposes a headless backend, XDG top-level events, scene
  primitives, and seats directly. It is a strong option if Qt cannot provide the
  required buffer and damage behavior. It also requires DeskPort to implement
  more compositor policy, configure/ack handling, popup rules, rendering, and
  input ownership immediately, while adding a new C library and packaging pin.
- **Qt Wayland Compositor:** it minimizes the first implementation and packaging
  delta and has a public surface-grab API. The tradeoff is that GPU and unusual
  buffer types may require a custom `grabSurface()` implementation later. M2 is
  therefore restricted to software/`wl_shm` validation.

Qt client windows and a server compositor solve different problems. Creating
multiple local Qt windows does not discover or render application surfaces on a
headless server; a server compositor is still required.

## Protocol and channel separation

The shared protocol version starts at:

```c
#define DP_SEAMLESS_PROTOCOL_VERSION 1
```

The detailed wire contract and bounds live in
`shared/deskport-core/protocol/SEAMLESS_MODE.md`. Its version 1 constants and
fixtures are implemented in the current shared-core working tree, but that core
revision is not yet published or pinned by the desktop flake. Most reserved
lifecycle messages are intentionally disabled until admission and media
milestones land.

### Control channel

The implemented M1 control path reuses the approved peer certificate, mutual TLS,
certificate pinning, and bounded newline-delimited JSON convention already used
by peer control. It accepts exactly one `seamless-negotiate` request on a fresh
approved-peer connection, returns one `seamless-result`, and closes that preflight
connection. It does **not** acquire a session lease, start the sidecar, or admit
media or input.

A future admitted Seamless control session is suitable for small messages such
as:

- capability and version negotiation;
- session start, ready, error, heartbeat, stop, and release;
- window create, title/app ID update, map/configure, and destroy; and
- later input, focus, close, and resize requests.

The preflight request is accepted only when the host advertised the version and
the peer is already approved. An accepted result proves only mode/version
compatibility. All lifecycle, media, input, focus, close, and resize messages must
remain disabled until a future authenticated, cross-mode exclusive Seamless lease
is admitted. A Desktop-only or older peer must receive an unsupported result or
continue on the existing Desktop path; it must never guess the mode from an
unknown message.

Window IDs are opaque and scoped to one admitted session. They are not process
IDs, Wayland object IDs, or reusable global identifiers. The server owns ID
allocation; a destroyed ID is not reused during the session. Every message is
validated for type, version, state, ID, dimensions, sequence, and bounded text.

The existing non-clipboard peer frame limit is 32 KiB. Pixel payloads therefore
must never be base64-encoded into the control JSON stream.

### Media channel

A separate binary media channel is a future M3 requirement. It must reuse the
same DeskPort identity and a new exclusive Seamless session lease instead of
inventing another trust system. The receiver must bind the channel to that
admitted session before accepting payloads; the current preflight is insufficient.

The initial binary framing should include, at minimum, a magic value, protocol
version, record type, window ID, sequence, dimensions/stride or damage rectangle,
codec/format, and payload length. All lengths and dimensions require hard limits,
checked arithmetic, bounded queues, and backpressure. Stale, duplicate, unknown,
or destroyed window IDs are rejected without affecting Desktop Mode.

M3 may use a correctness-first full BGRA frame or a simple bounded lossless
encoding for one small window. M6 adds damage-driven updates and eliminates idle
traffic. Existing WebRTC/H.264 work can be evaluated later, after a generic
per-surface encoder input and a native receiver exist.

## Server module boundaries

The intended server boundary is:

```text
app/backend/SeamlessHostManager (implemented local supervisor)
  - exact sidecar process supervision and cleanup
  - bounded sidecar JSON validation and local lifecycle state
  - no admission lease or control/media channel binding yet
  - no compositor internals

host/linux/seamless/deskport-seamless-host
  - private Wayland display
  - QtWaylandCompositor + XDG shell
  - surface registry and stable session IDs
  - owned application launcher
  - local lifecycle/capture output
  - no remote trust database or public listener
```

The exact source filenames inside `host/linux/seamless/` may change while the M2
skeleton settles, but the process and authority boundary should not.

The sidecar skeleton also contains a known-pixel `wl_shm` self-test client. It
checks local create/damage/capture/hash/destroy behavior without a network
transport. On 2026-10-05 the package and this probe passed on the native x86_64
Linux host `wmn`, including exact child and Wayland-socket cleanup. That host has
a render device, so the stricter no-`/dev/dri` VPS condition remains unverified.

For M2, a successful local result is limited to:

1. the sidecar creates its private Wayland socket;
2. one software-rendered test application connects to that socket;
3. one XDG top-level is created and receives an ID;
4. title, app ID, map/configure, buffer, and destroy events are logged or emitted;
5. the capture skeleton can produce a bounded local image or an explicit
   unsupported-buffer error; and
6. the launched process, socket, and sidecar are cleaned up.

This does **not** mean that the surface was authenticated, encoded, sent over the
network, displayed on a remote client, or driven by remote input.

## Client module boundaries

The planned Linux client boundary is:

```text
SeamlessClientSession
  - pinned TLS negotiation and session lifecycle
  - control/media receive loops
  - validates and orders remote events
            |
            v
SeamlessWindowRegistry
  - maps one session-scoped remote ID to one local window
  - owns create/title/destroy ordering
            |
            v
SeamlessWindow : QWindow
  - parentless native top-level
  - QBackingStore/QImage software renderer for the first proof
  - later local focus/input/close/resize events
```

All `QWindow` creation, destruction, and painting occurs on the Qt GUI thread.
Network or decode workers deliver immutable frame data through queued calls. The
local compositor decides placement; Wayland clients cannot force global window
coordinates. The initial local application ID may remain DeskPort's ID, so some
desktops may group the remote windows even though each is a real top-level.

Do not wrap a Qt Wayland window with `SDL_CreateWindowFrom()`. It creates unclear
event and rendering ownership and does not remove the legacy single-window
Moonlight assumptions. SDL remains the proven Desktop Mode renderer.

## Milestones and current status

The status language below is intentionally conservative. A build or local
surface callback is not remote streaming acceptance.

| Milestone | Scope | Status on this experimental branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Repository audit, architecture, dependencies, risks | **Complete in design.** This document records the chosen boundaries. |
| M1 | Explicit `desktop\|seamless` mode plumbing and versioned negotiation; no pixels | **Partially implemented on the server.** The shared-core contract/fixtures and an approved-peer, one-shot preflight exist. A production Linux client emitter/consumer and a cross-mode exclusive Seamless lease do not. Preflight acceptance does not admit a session. |
| M2 | Headless Wayland sidecar, launch one test application, discover one top-level, lifecycle and capture skeleton | **Local skeleton implemented and verified on one native Linux host.** The packaged sidecar passed its known-pixel `wl_shm` lifecycle/capture/hash/cleanup probe on `wmn`. An external terminal and a no-`/dev/dri` VPS remain compatibility gates. This is not encoding, authenticated transport, remote rendering, or input. |
| M3 | Capture, transmit, and display one surface in one native client window | **Future/TODO.** Requires the authenticated media channel and client renderer. |
| M4 | Window-scoped keyboard, pointer, focus, and close | **Future/TODO.** Existing global `LiSend*` input is not reused directly. |
| M5 | Local resize to remote XDG configure/ack and redraw | **Future/TODO.** Temporary local scaling may hide round-trip latency. |
| M6 | Damage-driven updates and near-zero idle traffic | **Future/TODO.** Requires measured damage and queue/encoder policy. |
| M7 | Multiple remote top-levels in multiple local top-levels | **Future/TODO.** One session owns the registry; do not create one transport per window. |

Update this table only when the matching test boundary is present. In particular,
do not move M3 to complete after seeing a local captured `QImage`.

## Dependencies

M0/M1 use existing Qt Core/Network, TLS, and shared-core dependencies.

The M2 sidecar adds the Qt Wayland Compositor module to its own target. The Linux
package must provide its development/runtime libraries and Wayland server
dependency without adding them to the Desktop media process unnecessarily. The
sidecar also needs:

- a private, mode `0700` `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or a private socket inside the user's
  existing runtime directory;
- a unique `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` socket owned by the session;
- Qt XDG shell support;
- a software-capable Qt platform/rendering path; and
- one explicitly selected test application for lifecycle checks.

The first supported buffer contract is `wl_shm`. Linux DMA-BUF, EGL, Vulkan,
hardware encoding, XWayland, popups, subsurfaces, and nontrivial decorations are
not implied by a successful M2 check.

## Security and cleanup

- Seamless Mode is opt-in and capability-gated.
- The normal peer certificate and binding remain the root of trust.
- The current one-shot Seamless preflight does not acquire, reserve, or extend an
  existing session lease. Before M3, admission must enforce one cross-mode
  exclusive owner across Desktop, browser, and Seamless capture/input.
- The sidecar listens only on a private Unix Wayland socket. It must not expose a
  new unauthenticated TCP listener.
- Environment passed to remote applications is allowlisted. Credentials,
  management secrets, unrelated display sockets, and host environment details are
  not forwarded.
- Titles and app IDs are untrusted bounded text. They are metadata, not commands
  or local desktop-file paths.
- Window IDs, dimensions, rectangle arithmetic, payload lengths, queue depth, and
  update rates are validated before allocation or copy.
- On normal exit, error, timeout, or cancellation, stop owned applications, close
  media/control channels, remove the private socket/runtime artifacts, and stop
  the sidecar. Once the Seamless lease exists, release it only after that cleanup.
- Never kill processes by a broad executable-name match. Supervision owns exact
  child process handles/PIDs.

## Build and test commands

Keep build and test output under the project build root. From the repository root:

```sh
source scripts/build-paths.sh
mkdir -p "$DESKPORT_CHECKOUT_BUILD_ROOT/seamless/core"

cmake -S shared/deskport-core \
  -B "$DESKPORT_CHECKOUT_BUILD_ROOT/seamless/core" \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build "$DESKPORT_CHECKOUT_BUILD_ROOT/seamless/core"
ctest --test-dir "$DESKPORT_CHECKOUT_BUILD_ROOT/seamless/core" \
  --output-on-failure

nix develop -c python3 scripts/test-core.py
nix develop -c python3 scripts/test-seamless-host-manager.py
nix develop -c python3 scripts/test-host-lifecycle.py --binding
```

`scripts/test-core.py` now invokes the shared-core Seamless protocol fixture in
addition to the session graph, catalog, and workspace adapter checks.
`scripts/test-seamless-host-manager.py` builds an isolated fake-sidecar regression
that checks bounded JSON handling and exact-child teardown. Neither test exercises
QtWaylandCompositor or a native Linux display stack.

After building the helper on native Linux, the local M2 probe is:

```sh
deskport-seamless-host --self-test --width 320 --height 200
```

That probe passed from the Nix package on native x86_64 Linux (`wmn`) on
2026-10-05. The known-pixel hash proves only local `wl_shm` lifecycle/capture and
cleanup; it sends no pixels over a DeskPort connection.

The sidecar target is wired into the qmake/Nix path. Until the changed shared-core
revision is published and pinned, validate the complete working tree with an
explicit local input override:

```sh
nix build --no-write-lock-file \
  --override-input deskport-core "path:$PWD/shared/deskport-core" \
  .#packages.x86_64-linux.default
```

That override build passed on `wmn` on 2026-10-05. The normal locked build is not
a release gate until the core commit is published and both the submodule and
`flake.lock` are advanced together.

Remaining targeted coverage for M1/M2 includes:

- optional-capability downgrade and Desktop/Seamless isolation;
- start/ready/stop state ordering, duplicate requests, timeout, and revocation;
- malformed version, ID, dimension, title/app ID, and oversized messages;
- deterministic create/configure/destroy lifecycle for one fake or test client;
- supported `wl_shm` capture and explicit rejection of unsupported buffers;
- child crash, compositor crash, client disconnect, and cancellation cleanup; and
- proof that no owned PID, socket, or runtime artifact remains after each case.

An isolated Wayland integration test must inventory existing compositor/test
processes first, use one owned instance, record its PID and socket, and tear it
down in a `finally`/trap path. It is a compositor-process test, not proof of a
real VPS, native input, latency, or deployed-package behavior.

## Run and debug interfaces

The intended user-facing mode selection is:

```sh
# Existing behavior; remains the default.
deskport host run --mode desktop

# M1/M2 experimental route. This is not a streaming-complete command until M3.
deskport host run --mode seamless
```

The mode parser and local `SeamlessHostManager` route have landed. The Seamless
command currently starts only the local sidecar path; it is not a production
remote client session and must not be presented as streaming-complete.

The sidecar is an internal helper, not a stable public CLI. During M2 development,
use its actual `--help` output rather than copying provisional flags:

```sh
deskport-seamless-host --help
```

Useful diagnostics for an owned local fixture include:

```sh
QT_LOGGING_RULES='qt.waylandcompositor.*=true' \
WAYLAND_DEBUG=server \
deskport-seamless-host --help
```

The final M2 integration test should print the private socket name, stable session
window ID, bounded title/app ID, buffer type and size, lifecycle order, child PID,
and cleanup result. It must not print peer certificates, access tokens, clipboard
contents, or captured application pixels.

The future M3 end-to-end command sequence will need an admitted client and a
remote application launch command. Its syntax is intentionally not documented as
working yet. Do not present `deskport connect`, `deskport run`, per-window input,
or remote frame delivery as implemented until their actual parser, protocol, and
integration tests exist.

## Known risks and limitations

- **Buffer compatibility:** the first proof is `wl_shm` only. Modern browsers and
  GPU applications commonly use DMA-BUF/EGL paths.
- **Capture cost:** surface grabbing and `QBackingStore` can copy pixels more than
  once. That is acceptable for correctness, not a performance conclusion.
- **Damage semantics:** a buffer commit is not yet an efficient damage encoder.
  M6 must preserve damage ordering and coalesce updates without losing content.
- **XDG configure ordering:** resize requires configure/ack discipline. Scaling an
  old buffer is only a temporary visual bridge, not completion of M5.
- **Popups and subsurfaces:** menus, tooltips, dialogs, and transient parents need
  an explicit mapping policy. Perfect handling is outside the first milestone.
- **Input:** the Desktop handler sends global Moonlight input. Seamless input must
  address a window and compositor seat and must release held state on focus loss,
  disconnect, or destroyed windows.
- **Window identity:** the local app ID initially remains DeskPort's identity.
  Compositors may group multiple remote top-levels even though they are independent
  native windows.
- **Wayland placement:** the client cannot choose absolute top-level coordinates;
  local placement belongs to the local compositor.
- **Resource limits:** a 1-2 vCPU/1-2 GiB host requires bounded windows, pixels,
  frame queues, and update rate. Static windows should eventually send no media.
- **API evolution:** Qt capture limitations may still force a later wlroots or
  custom capture backend. Keep `CompositorBackend`/capture interfaces narrow.
- **Test scope:** local lifecycle, build, or pixel checks are not evidence of
  deployed VPS reliability, physical client input, display-to-photon latency, or
  release readiness.

## Completion criteria before M3

The server skeleton does not satisfy the full M1/M2 product boundary yet. Before
starting M3, all of the following must be true:

1. this architecture and the shared protocol contract agree;
2. Desktop Mode remains the default and its targeted regressions pass;
3. old peers and Desktop-only peers cannot enter Seamless Mode;
4. a production Linux client emits/consumes the negotiated messages and an
   admitted cross-mode exclusive Seamless session has bounded start/stop/error
   semantics;
5. the sidecar launches one software-rendered test application on a private
   Wayland socket (a terminal remains the first external compatibility target);
6. one top-level receives a stable session ID and ordered lifecycle events;
7. the local capture skeleton returns a bounded `wl_shm` image or a precise error;
8. no remote pixel transport or client rendering is claimed;
9. failure and cancellation leave no owned child, socket, or lease; and
10. source, package, deployment, and physical acceptance remain reported as
    separate states.
